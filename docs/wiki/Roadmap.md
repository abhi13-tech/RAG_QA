Roadmap

Planned
- Proper BM25 baseline and comparison vs TF‑IDF
- Per‑query diffs/plots for variant comparisons
- Entailment‑based faithfulness scoring (when models available)
- OpenTelemetry tracing + Prometheus metrics exporters
- Scripted QA generation from data/raw/ for larger eval sets

Nice‑to‑have
- Admin UI for index status and eval runs
- API auth (keys) + rate limiting
